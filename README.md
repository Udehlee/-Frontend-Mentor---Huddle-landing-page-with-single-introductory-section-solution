### What I learned
I learned how to make a text responsive using vw units.
proud of this css code

.text-column h1{
            font-size: 3vw;
            font-family: var(--ff--Poppins);
            line-height: 1.5;
}

### Continued development
I do hope to sharpen my media queries approach on responsive design.
